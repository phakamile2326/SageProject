#SAGE Community Association

##SAGE Community Association aims to create a lively and welcoming community by running the Sage library, providing a friendly space 
for people of all ages and interests to explore books.

##This is a class project that was done to show how collaboration works and how you can create a project using HTML, CSS and JS.
The class of 13 people was divided, with 5 people doing HTML,4 people doing CSS, and 4 people doing JS. The class also had to 
upload their progress on the collective account on Github.
